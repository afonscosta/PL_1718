File Structure
       Thesaurus used with this module are standard ASCII documents. This file
       can contain processing instructions, comments or term definitions. The
       instructions area is used to define 
            * new relations and 
            * mathematical properties between them.

          ______________
         |              |
         |    HEADER    | --> processing instructions,
         |______________|     comment or empty lines.
         |              |
         |  Def Term 1  | --> Each term definition should be separated
         |              |     from each other with an empty line.
         |  Def Term 2  |
         |              |
         |     .....    |
         |              |
         |  Def Term n  |
         |______________|

       Comments can appear on any line. Meanwhile, the comment character (#)
       should be the first character on the line (with no spaces before).
       Comments line span to the end of the line (until the first carriage
       return).

       Processing instructions lines, like comments, should start with the
       percent sign (%). We describe these instructions later on this document.

       Terms definitions can't contain any empty line because they are used to
       separate definitions from each other. On the first line of term definition
       record should appear the defined term. Next lines defines relations with
       other terms. The first characters should be an abbreviation of the
       relation (on upper case) and spaces. Then, should appear a comma separated
       list of terms.

       There can be more than one line with the same relation. Thesaurus module
       will concatenate the lists. If you want to continue a list on the next
       line you can repeat the relation term of leave some spaces between the
       start of the line and the terms list.

       Here is an example:

         Animal
         NT cat, dog, cow,
            fish, ant
         NT camel
         BT Life being

         cat
         BT Animal
         SN domestic animal to be kicked when
            anything bad occurs.

       There can be defined a special term ("_top_"). It should be used when you
       want a top tree for thesaurus navigation. So, we normally define the
       "_top_" term with the more interesting terms to be navigated.


RELATIONS

   The user can use any relations he wants.

   The ISO sugests the

       NT - Narrower Term
           Terms more specific than current term.  (inv BT)

       BT - Broader Term
           More generic terms than current term.  (inv NT)

       RT - Related Term
           Related term that can't be inserted on any other category. (int RT)

       SN - Scope Note
           Text. Note of context of the current term. Use for definitions or
           comments about the scope you are using that term.

       USE - (non preferencial) Synonym
           tipically a remissive term  (inv UF)

       UF - Quasi-Synonym
           Terms that are no synonyms of current term but can be used, sometimes
           with that meaning.  (inv USE)

       TT - Top Term
           The broadest term we can define about the current term.


   Processing Instructions
       Processing instructions, as said before, are written on a line starting
       with the percent sign. Current commands are:

       top When presenting a thesaurus, we need a term, to know where to start.
           Normally, we want the thesaurus to have some kind of top level, where
           to start navigating. This command specifies that term, the term that
           should be used when no term is specified.

           Example:

             %top Contents

             Contents
             NT Biography ...
             RT ...

       encoding
           This command defines the encoding used in the thesaurus file.

           Example:

            %enc utf8

       inverse
           This command defines the mathematic inverse of the relation. That is,
           if you define "inverse A B" and you know that "foo" is related by "A"
           with "bar", then, "bar" is related by "B" with "foo".

           Example:

             %inv BT NT
             %inverse UF USE

       description
           This command defines a description for some relation class. These
           descriptions are used when outputting thesaurus on HTML.

           Example:

             %desc SN Note of Scope
             %description IOF Instance of

           If you are constructing a multi-lingue thesaurus, you will want to
           translate the relation class description. To do this, you should use
           the "description" command with the language in from of it:

             %desc[PT] SN Nota de Contexto
             %description[PT] IOF Instancia de

       externals
           This defines classes that does not relate terms but, instead, relate a
           term with some text (a scope note, an url, etc.). This can be used
           like this:

             %ext SN URL
             %externals SN URL

           Note that you can specify more than one relation type per line.

       languages
           This other command permits the construction of a multi-lingue
           thesaurus. TO specify languages classifiers (like PT, EN, FR, and so
           on) you can use one of these lines:

             %lang PT EN FR
             %languages PT EN FR

           To describe (legend) the language names, you should use the
           description command, so, you could append:

             %description PT Portuguese
             %description EN English
             %description FR French

       baselanguage
           This one makes it possible to explicitly name the base language for
           the thesaurus. This command should be used with the "description" one,
           to describe the language name. Here is a simple example:

             %baselang PT
             %languages EN FR

             %description PT Portuguese
             %description EN English
             %description FR French
